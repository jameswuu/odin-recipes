        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This Creamy Mushroom Pasta speaks for itself. A slippery tangle of pasta bathed in a creamy parmesan 
            sauce loaded with buttery garlic mushrooms, it's simple, quick, and utterly luxurious!        
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Mushrom</li>
            <li>White Wine</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Cook pasta in salted water for 1 minute less than the package time (start this while cooking mushrooms). Before draining, scoop out 1 cup of cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt butter and heat oil over high heat.</li>
            <li>Add mushrooms and cook, stirring regularly. When they start to sweat, add a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>When mushrooms are golden (about 4-5 minutes), add garlic and cook until both are golden.</li>
            <li>Stand back and add wine (it will be steamy!). Stir and scrape the bottom of the skillet. Simmer until the wine is mostly evaporated and the smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add broth, cream, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Stir to dissolve the parmesan and simmer for 2 minutes, stirring regularly.</li>
            <li>Transfer the drained pasta into the sauce and toss for 1-2 minutes until the sauce thickens and coats the pasta. If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of reserved pasta cooking water.</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and serve immediately with extra parmesan.</li>
         </ol>
