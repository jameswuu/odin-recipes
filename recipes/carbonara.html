        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Carbonara is a beautiful, classic Italian pasta that's so creamy, you'd swear there's a 
            good amount of cream in it. And indeed, there's plenty of recipes that cheat by adding in cream.
            But today, we're making spaghetti carbonara properly, the authentic, traditional way. 
            No cream. Just egg, cheese and a splash of starchy pasta cooking water.            
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Guanciale</li>
            <li>Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
            <li>Egg Yolks and Whole Eggs</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Garlic (optional)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Prepare Guanciale: Cut into 0.5 cm (1/5") thick slices, then into batons.</li>
            <li>Make Carbonara Sauce: In a large bowl, whisk together eggs and yolks, then stir in parmesan and pepper.</li>
            <li>Cook Pasta: Bring 4 liters (4 quarts) of salted water to a boil, add pasta, and cook according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Reserve Pasta Water: Before draining, scoop out 1 cup of pasta cooking water, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Cook Guanciale: In a non-stick pan over medium-high heat, cook guanciale for 4 to 5 minutes until golden (no oil needed). If using garlic, add it in the last minute.</li>
            <li>Combine Pasta and Guanciale: Add the hot pasta to the pan and toss to coat in guanciale fat.</li>
            <li>Mix Pasta in Sauce: Transfer pasta and residual fat into the bowl with the egg mixture. Add 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water. Stir vigorously for 1 minute until the sauce becomes creamy.</li>
            <li>Serve: Transfer to warm bowls and serve immediately, garnished with extra parmesan, black pepper, and finely chopped parsley if desired.</li>
         </ol>
